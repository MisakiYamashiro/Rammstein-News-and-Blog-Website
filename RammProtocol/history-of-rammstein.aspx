        <div class="member-biography-text">
            <p>Rammstein was founded by guitarist <a href="richard-kruspe.aspx">Richard Z. Kruspe</a>. In 1989, he escaped to West Berlin and started the band Orgasm Death Gimmicks. At that time, he was heavily influenced by American music, especially Kiss. After the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back home to Schwerin, where <a href="till-lindemann.aspx">Till Lindemann</a> worked as a basket-weaver, played drums in the band First Arsch. At this time, Richard lived with <a href="oliver-riedel.aspx">Oliver Riedel</a>, of the band The Inchtabokatables, and <a href="christoph-schneider.aspx">Christoph "Doom" Schneider</a> (of Die Firma). Richard realized that the music he had previously created did not properly suit him; He envisioned something that would combine machines and the sound of heavy guitars. The three started working together on a new project. Richard soon found it extremely difficult to write both music and lyrics at the same time, so he talked <a href="till-lindemann.aspx">Lindemann</a> into joining Rammstein. Richard first discovered Till when he overheard him singing while he was working. A contest was held in Berlin for amateur bands in 1994, the winner of which would receive the opportunity to record a four-track demo audiotape in a professional studio. Kruspe, Schneider, Riedel and <a href="till-lindemann.aspx">Lindemann</a> entered and won the contest, which caught the attention of <a href="paul-landers.aspx">Paul H. Landers</a>, who wanted in on the project upon hearing their demo. To complete their sound, Rammstein then attempted to recruit <a href="christian-lorenz.aspx">Christian "Flake" Lorenz</a>, who used to play with <a href="paul-landers.aspx">Landers</a> in Feeling B. At first <a href="christian-lorenz.aspx">Lorenz</a> was hesitant, but eventually agreed to join the band.</p>

            <label>Herzeleid (1995-1997)</label>

            <br />

        </div>
        <div class="member-biography-text">
            <p>Rammstein began to record their first studio album entitled **Herzeleid** in March 1995 with producer Jacob Hellner. They released their first single **Du riechst so gut** on 17 August and later released the album on 24 September 1995. Later that same year, they toured with Clawfinger in Warsaw and Prague. Rammstein headlined a tour of their own through Germany from 2 December to 22 December consisting of 17 shows which helped to boost the band's popularity. They then went on several tours throughout early 1996, releasing their second single entitled **Seemann** on 8 January 1996. On 27 March, Rammstein performed on MTV's Hanging Out in London; their first performance in the UK. Rammstein's first major boost in popularity outside Germany came when music director Trent Reznor chose two Rammstein songs, **Heirate mich** and **Rammstein**, for David Lynch's film Lost Highway. The soundtrack for the film was released in the US in the fall of 1996 and later throughout Europe in April 1997. Rammstein then went on to tour through Germany, Austria and Switzerland from September to October 1996, performing an anniversary concert on 27 September called "100 years of Rammstein". Guests to the concert included Moby, Bobo and The Berlin Session Orchestra, Berlin director Gert Hof was responsible for the light show.</p>

        <div class="member-biography-text">
            <p>Rammstein started recording **Sehnsucht** in November 1996 at the Temple Studios in Malta. The album was again produced by Jacob Hellner. The first single off the album, entitled **Engel** was released on 1 April 1997 and later reached gold status in Germany on 23 May. This prompted the release of a fan edition of the single, named **Engel (fan edition)**. This contained two previously unreleased songs, **Feuerräder** and **Wilder Wein**. Release of the second single from the album Sehnsucht was **Du hast**, which hit the German single charts August 1997 at number 5. Rammstein then continued touring in the summer whilst Sehnsucht was released on 22 August 1997. The album reached number 1 in Germany after only two weeks in the charts. Simultaneously, Herzeleid and both the singles off Sehnsucht (**Du hast** and **Engel**) were in the Top 20 of the German charts. Rammstein continued to headline sold out shows throughout Europe in September, October and November 1997 before releasing their cover of Kraftwerk's **Das Modell**. The single included another unreleased song entitled **Kokain**. On 5 December 1997, Rammstein embarked on their first tour of the United States with KMFDM. On 22 and 23 August 1998, Rammstein played to over 17,000 fans at the Wuhlheide in Berlin; the biggest show the band have ever played there up to that date. Supporting acts were Danzig, Nina Hagen, Joachim Witt and Alaska. The show was professionally filmed, intended to be released on their upcoming live DVD, **Live aus Berlin**. Rammstein embarked on a live tour with Korn, Ice Cube, Orgy and Limp Bizkit called the Family Values tour in September through to late October 1998. To further continue their success in the US, Sehnsucht received Gold record status on 2 November. The Band was nominated at the MTV European Music Awards for Best Rock Act and performed **Du hast** live on 12 November that year. Rammstein had further success in 1999, starting off the year in February with a nomination for Best Metal Performance at the 42nd-annual Grammy Awards. A year after it was filmed, the **Live aus Berlin** concert was released on CD on 30 August 1999, with a limited edition double CD also available. Two weeks after it was released, **Live aus Berlin** went to number one in the German Album Charts. On 13 September and 26 November 1999 the video and DVD versions of the concert were released respectively.</p>

            <label>Liebe ist für alle da (2007-Present)</label>

            <br />

        </div>
        <div class="member-biography-text">
            <p>The band took a time out in 2006, and began work again in 2007. In an interview with German rapper Bushido (who contributed the "Electro Ghetto remix" of Amerika) on 21 January 2007, Bushido reported recording a song with Rammstein, called **Vergiss uns nicht** ("Don't forget us"). In this interview, Bushido also mentioned that he was unsure whether it would be on their "best of" album or not. This was the first mention of a "best of" album, or the new album all together. In addition, keyboardist <a href="christian-lorenz.aspx">Christian "Flake" Lorenz</a> confirmed this in an interview with Metal Hammer Germany in November, stating that they would have most likely released a new album in 2008. The band did not tour during 2007 due to album production. Their website confirmed work on a new album, but no word of a "best of" album has yet been mentioned. In January 2008, guitarist <a href="richard-kruspe.aspx">Richard Kruspe</a> confirmed on the Talking Metal Podcast that Rammstein was recording an album as they spoke, during that same interview he confirmed a "big world tour" following the next album to contain US dates. On 4 November, the band finished the pre-production in Berlin and went to the Henson Studio in Los Angeles. After 7 intensive weeks they had recorded the drums, guitars and most of the vocals. Two very short (less than two minutes) "making of" videos have been released during the development of the album. One video, released on the band's website, shows drummer <a href="christoph-schneider.aspx">Christoph "Doom" Schneider</a> recording drums for one of the tracks (**Mehr**), and the second, released on the band's MySpace page, features keyboardist <a href="christian-lorenz.aspx">Flake Lorenz</a> practicing notes for another track. On 6 May 2009, Rammstein announced a European Tour dates on their website. The June '09 release of Metal Hammer featured an interview with Rammstein-manager Emanuel Fialik. In regard to the upcoming album Fialik quoted *Musically, it has the force of Mutter while the beauty of the melodies of Sehnsucht - Just so it has fixed in my ears.* and also that it will feature two soft ballads and the rest will be hard as a rock. He even went as far to say that the disk is the biggest surprise since the birth of his son. The interview concluded with Fialik stating *It is musically the best Album, which until now has Rammstein recorded!* In July 2009, the track **Liebe ist für alle da** leaked onto the internet, along with promotional materials. This has led Universal Music to take action against certain fan sites. It was confirmed in August 2009 that the new album will have 11 tracks, and mixing of the album - which was taking place in Stockholm - has been completed. On September 2009, it was confirmed on the band's website that **Pussy** will be the first single from the new album. On the same day, The Gauntlet posted a promotional video for it. The video also confirmed the new album title, **Liebe ist für alle da**. Later, the title was confirmed again in an interview with <a href="paul-landers.aspx">Paul Landers</a> for RockOne magazine. The music video for **Pussy** was released 30 minutes early on September 16, 2009, at 20:30 GMT, released especially for the adult website Visit-x. The video contains graphic scenes of male and female nudity as well as women engaging in sexual activity with the band members. Metal Hammer released an edited version of the video onto their website. The video for **Ich tu dir weh** was released on December 21, 2009 on the adult website Visit-x; it depicts the band on stage in a similar configuration as the one on their 2009/10 tour. The single was released on January 15, 2010. On Friday April 23, 2010, Rammstein released their video **Haifisch**. Unlike the video for **Ich tu dir weh**, it contains more of a storyline rather than a performance. The single was released May 28, 2010. On November 8, 2009 Rammstein began the first leg of the **Liebe ist für alle da** tour in Lisbon, Portugal. As part of their European summer tour, Rammstein performed at the 2010 Rock am Ring Festival on 4–6 June 2010. They also headlined several shows across Europe on the Sonisphere Festival, including their first ever outdoor UK performance at Knebworth Park, performing the day before Iron Maiden. On Sunday July 18, 2010, Rammstein played in front of more than 130,000 people in Quebec City on the Plains of Abraham as the closing show for the Festival d'été de Québec. It was their first North American appearance in 9 years. The band announced that their last tour dates of 2010 were to be in the Americas. After several South American dates, the band returned to the United States for a single show at the famous Madison Square Garden in New York City - their first US show in over nine years. They also performed at Bell Centre in Montreal, Canada on December 9. This concert also sold out within the first hour of tickets going on sale, indicating a high demand to see Rammstein in North America. The band then played at Big Day Out 2011 from January 21 to February 6 in New Zealand and Australia. The band also visited South Africa for the first time in 2011 and played two concerts at Cape Town and Johannesburg. On February 16, 2011, Rammstein announced that after the massive success of their sold out Madison Square Garden show on December 11, 2010 they would be touring North America after 10 years to a total of six US dates, three Canadian dates, and four Mexican dates. On April 20, 2011 the band also won the Revolver Golden God Award for best live band, their first US award.</p>
