# üî• Rammstein Fan Hub - A JavaScript-Free Web Project

A dynamic, database-driven fan website for the German metal band Rammstein. This project delivers a rich content experience including news, a full discography, media galleries, and interactive user comments. The entire front-end and back-end were built using the **ASP.NET framework** and **C#**, with a notable challenge: **no JavaScript was used.**

## üöÄ Project Overview

This website serves as a central hub for Rammstein fans, providing up-to-date information dynamically pulled from a database. The focus was on creating a robust back-end with **ADO.NET** for data access and a clean, styled front-end using only **HTML and CSS**. This project demonstrates the power of server-side rendering with ASP.NET to create a feature-rich, interactive user experience without relying on client-side scripting.
